The DDS Foundation hosted a [webinar](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/12231/402845) that's now available as a recording.  In this session, panelists from DDS technology providers (including Adam Mitz from Object Computing) each discussed an area of active development and took questions from the live audience.
