Until the introduction of OpenDDSharp, developers who wanted to use OpenDDS in a .NET application had to download and build OpenDDS on their systems and write interface code to access the OpenDDS DLLs. With the OpenDDSharp project, you gain access to pre-built binaries for a specific OpenDDS version in the form of an IDL Project extension and a NuGet package for interfacing your .NET projects with OpenDDS. 

OpenDDS team member, Tim Pollock, recently published an article demonstrating how to use OpenDDSharp to add DDS publish-subscribe communications to a .NET application.
