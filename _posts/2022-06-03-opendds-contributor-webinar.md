Have you thought about contributing to the OpenDDS project but weren't sure how to get started? We get it. Contributing to open source projects can be intimidating, even for those who have done it before if theyâ€™re not familiar with a particular project. 

In this upcoming webinar, the OpenDDS team goes over the steps to contribute to the OpenDDS project, from setting up an environment to build and test changes to getting a pull request merged.

The following topics are covered in this webinar:

- Setting up a development environment
- Resources
- Running and interpreting the lint script
- Testing
- Opening a pull request
- Contributing in other areas of the OpenDDS project
- Contributing to related repositories
