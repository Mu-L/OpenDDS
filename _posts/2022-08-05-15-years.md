Members of the OpenDDS development team gathered last month to celebrate the project's birthday. OpenDDS middleware has been providing powerful connectivity solutions for 15 years!

The technology's official birthday occurred on July 9th, which marks the day OpenDDS version 1.0 was released in 2007. Since then, more than 75 developers have contributed, and the project has earned 937 stars on GitHub.

Previous OpenDDS Product Manager, Steve Totten, said, “I'm very proud of all that the OpenDDS developers have accomplished and how this important open source middleware project continues to evolve to meet the needs of its growing community.” Adam Mitz, OpenDDS Product Lead, added "Open source development is inherently a collaborative effort among maintainers and users. Thanks to everyone who's been involved in any way with the project over the last 15 years." 

The team enjoyed a small party with a cake in honor of the project's landmark anniversary.
