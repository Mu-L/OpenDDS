Potential OpenDDS users often have questions regarding the technology's performance, but it's always been difficult to answer specific questions about performance for particular applications in particular environments without first doing the work of developing test applications.

Join us on **November 18th** for a complimentary webinar in which OpenDDS development team member, **Tim Simpson**, introduces **Bench**, a new performance-testing framework that's being developed to enable large-scale testing of OpenDDS discovery and transport mechanisms.

By taking advantage of the OpenDDS Bench framework, users can potentially design large-scale tests that run in their own custom testing environments with little to no need for application development.
