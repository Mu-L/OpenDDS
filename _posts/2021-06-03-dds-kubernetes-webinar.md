Our friends over at Object Management Group and the DDS Foundation present a special student presentation on DDS in multi-platform Kubernetes container deployment on June 9, 2021, at 10am CDT.

Deploying and managing large-scale distributed DDS applications is tedious and the feasibility of running DDS applications in a Kubernetes (k8s) environment has not been extensively studied. This gave rise to an automated benchmark framework designed to analyze potential bottlenecks of several popular k8s virtual network plugins and a comprehensive set of experiments to demonstrate DDS performance variation under different QoS and k8s network configurations.

The presentation will be followed by a Q&A session moderated by members of the DDS Foundation Technology Committee.
