Support for using CMake to build applications has been added to the 
latest development version of OpenDDS.  There are example applications 
[in the repository]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/tree/master/tests/cmake/Messenger)
in addition to [documentation]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/master/docs/cmake.md) to help get started.

To give it a try, clone the latest OpenDDS master and configure it with 
`--ace-github-latest` in addition to any options you normally use.  Once 
this OpenDDS version is compiled you can create CMake projects that use it.

If there are any issues please let us know on [the mailing list]({{ site.data.opendds.mailing_lists_uri }}) or using 
a GitHub Issue or Pull Request.
