The OpenDDS Foundation™ is pleased to announce a new partnership with
the [Unity Foundation](https://unityfoundation.io)™.

The OpenDDS Foundation is one of three Open Source Software (OSS)
Foundations joining the Unity Foundation as official member
organizations of the Unity team. Established in 2020 as a non-profit,
community-based organization, Unity set out on a journey to leverage
open source software tools to provide more inherently equitable access
to the information and services that support the needs of the greater
St. Louis area community, with a focus on the underserved.

Dr. Ebrahim Moshiri, founder of St. Louis-based technology company,
[Object Computing, Inc.](https://objectcomputing.com/) (OCI), envisioned a radically new way
of serving the community by extending all of the openly available
tools and systems that OCI had been building, supporting, and
advancing for the last three decades. The [Unity Foundation](https://unityfoundation.io/#projects) was
organized to drive the engineering of a new kind of CommUNITY
Infrastructure and data sharing ecosystem that, through collaborations
and partnerships with other St. Louis based organizations, can address
the digital divide in our region. In essence, Unity seeks to apply the
ideals of altruism, benevolence, and social consciousness to the world
of software tools and systems that organizations use to collect,
organize, and share data.

As a commitment to reusable and interoperable technologies to
facilitate greater access and capability for all users, OCI made
significant investments in establishing three OSS product
Foundations - the [OpenDDS Foundation](https://opendds.org/foundation/)™, the [Micronaut
Foundation](https://micronaut.io/foundation/)™, and the [Grails Foundation](https://grails.org/foundation/index.html)™. These
non-profit entities are solely focused on ensuring the continuity and
sustainability of our OSS products. Today, thousands of software
engineers, researchers, and end users around the globe use and
contribute to these trusted tools and platforms, including
organizations like Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle, and Google.

Moving the OpenDDS Foundation under Unity provides a meaningful
alliance between Unity and our amazing community. We are excited for
the opportunity to work closely with Unity to further develop an open
source technology infrastructure and ecosystem supporting our
underserved communities. Unity will continue its commitment to serve
as an OSS aggregator, and will scale community participation in
helping define, advance, and contribute to the ongoing success and
sustainability of the OpenDDS project.

In January 2023, Object Computing and the Unity Foundation together
pledged an additional $2M to the OpenDDS Foundation for the ongoing
benefit and advancement of the OpenDDS project. As the proud steward
of the OpenDDS Foundation, Unity continues its commitment to
innovative collaboration with community partners with a deep desire to
build and contribute to a new CommUNITY infrastructure - one that will
be engineered for equity, accessibility, enrichment, and compassion
for those who need it most.
