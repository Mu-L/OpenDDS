title:  "OpenDDS Support for IDL-to-C++11"
categories: news

The latest in-development OpenDDS version now
optionally uses the OMG IDL-to-C++11 specification for generating C++ 
code from the IDL you write for defining DDS Topic data types.

The IDL-to-C++11 spec is available [here](https://www.omg.org/spec/CPP11) (we 
are using v1.4) if you'd like to see all the details, but the main 
differences are:
- C++ standard library's string, array, and vector types are used for 
IDL string, array, and sequence
- C++11 scoped enums are used for IDL enums
- IDL structs and unions are translated to C++ classes with 
accessor/mutator functions

Note that IDL files processed using this new mapping cannot include IDL 
files that are processed with the default mapping.

There is a full example [in the repository]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/tree/master/tests/DCPS/C%2B%2B11/Messenger). To give it a try, clone the OpenDDS git repository (master branch) and 
configure it with `--ace-github-latest` in addition to any options you 
normally use.

If there are any issues please let us know on [the mailing list]({{ site.data.opendds.mailing_lists_uri }}) or using 
a GitHub Issue or Pull Request.  Complete documentation of this feature 
will be in the next version of the OpenDDS Developer's Guide.
