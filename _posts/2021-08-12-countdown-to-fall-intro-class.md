The enrollment period for Object Computing's fall "Introduction to OpenDDS Programming" course is approaching fast! Don't miss your chance to enroll in the last open-enrollment offering of this popular introductory class for 2021.

[Introduction to OpenDDS Programming](https://objectcomputing.com/services/training/catalog/middleware/opendds-programming-cpp-and-java)
September 1st and 2nd

This hands-on workshop is designed to get you up to speed with the DDS specification and the OpenDDS implementation in just a couple of days. One reason students who take this class master the technology so quickly is that it's not prerecorded â€“ you'll get clarification and answers to your questions in real time from a live instructor.

The enrollment deadline is **Tuesday, August 24th**, and space is limited, so [reserve your seat now](https://objectcomputing.com/services/training/catalog/middleware/opendds-programming-cpp-and-java)!
