.. news-start-section: Additions
- Added a new data member, ``monotonic_timestamp`` to the ``InternalThreadBuiltInTopic`` IDL struct.

  - ``monotonic_timestamp`` is the time of the sample was written (time of last update of this instance) on the monotonic clock.
  - On systems that don't support a monotonic clock, this will be the same value as the corresponding ``SampleInfo``'s ``source_timestamp``.

.. news-start-section: Fixes
- When :cfg:prop:`DCPSThreadStatusInterval` is enabled, threads that run the ACE Reactor now use timers instead of a time-limited ``select()`` system call to update the ``InternalThreadBuiltInTopic``.

  - This allows the ``InternalThreadBuiltInTopic`` to be updated accurately on systems that suspend/resume and are configured for boottime timers.
