          Improvements to configure Script

          - Fix uninitialized value warning
          - Tweak configure script output:
          - Bring `--help` mostly back to 80-ish columns.
          - Try to make new options a little more clear.
          - Use "cross-compile" instead of "cross compile" and "GoogleTest"
          instead of "Google Test", "CMake" instead of "cmake", etc.
          - `--mpc:OPT` should accept `--mpc:*=OPT=VALUE`.
          - Try to make how features are handled a little bit more sane by
          putting
          them all in `@features`. It's still not great and I know I'm at
          least
          partially to blame.
          - Try to put all features not in `default.features` in
          `opendds_mwc.pl`.
          - Add `OpenDDSCOnfig.h.bak*` to git ignore.

        commit 3aa1b0648a38879d9173d850a3b1f9af15235e26

        * dds/DCPS/ValueDispatcher.h:

          ValueDispatcher assumes pointer is KeyOnly

          Problem
          -------

          The ValueDispatcher code assumes the value indicated by the void*
          is a KeyOnly<T>*.  This is incorrect as the void* is a T*.

          Solution
          --------

          Assume the void* is a T* and construct the KeyOnly.

          Problem
          -------

          The DevGuide doesn't document `send_buffer_size` and
          `rcv_buffer_size`
          for the `rtps_udp` transport and RTPS Discovery.

          Add documentation.

          rtps_udp sends heartbeats when sending fragments

          Problem
          -------

          Suppose a writer has an agressive heartbeat period and then
          writes a
          sample that is highly fragmented. It is possible (probable) that
          the
          heartbeat timer will go off before all fragments have been sent.
          The
          reader can then nack fragments that haven't even been sent.  The
          writer would then resend the requested fragments.

          Solution
          --------

          Before sending a heartbeat, check that the user is not in the
          middle
          of a send.

          The solution does not make a change for resends due to
          reliability
          and/or durability. The reason for this is that sending heartbeats
          and
          nack responses are mutually exclusive based on locking.

          Fix Missing ACE with OPENDDS_ACE_TAO_SRC

          The ACE and TAO library targets from MPC might be called
          `ACE-target`
          and `TAO-target` depending on if they're in directories of the
          same
          name. It should be trivial to predict this, but the path logic
          for this
          in MPC seems buggy and might not prepend `-target` when
          `OPENDDS_ACE_TAO_SRC` is outside of the build directory, so we're
          just
          going to check both for all targets.

          Post 3.28.0 Release Script Improvements

          - Fixed an issue with uploading RTPS interop test to the OMG
          repo.
          - Update ACE/TAO Workflow:
          - Try to make it so it won't force push a new commit every time
          it
          runs but the PR hasn't been merged yet.
          - Generate a news fragment so the ACE/TAO update will be
          announced and
          users can see the ACE/TAO changes.
          - Try to improve the commit message and PR title and body so says
          which ACE/TAO was updated. Right now it always lists both.
          - Made `run_command` more useful when non-zero exit statuses are
          not
          considered errors.

        commit 95ef01cd1bf48bb4a0d4fd347ee3899b43587527

        * .github/workflows/build_and_test.yml:
        * .github/workflows/ishapes.yml:

        * docs/news.d/mpcopts.rst:

          `--mpcopts` values are split on spaces

          Problem
          -------

          `--mpcopts` is a `configure` script option that accumulates
          additional
          options for MPC.  These values are split on spaces so
          `--mpcopts='-value_template build_flags+=-Wall -Werror'` results
          in three
          arguments to MPC: `-value_template`, `build_flags+=-Wall` and
          `-Werror`.  This causes the configure script to fail because the
          arguments to MPC are incorrect.

          Solution
          --------

          Remove the splitting functionality.

          The examples above would now be written as
          * `--mpcopts=-value_template --mpcopts=build_flags+="-Wall
          -Werror"`

          Introduce a new option `--mpc:opt arg`. The examples would then
          be
          * `--mpc:value_template build_flags+="-Wall -Werror"`

        * tests/security/attributes/gov_gen.cpp:

          `gov_gen` uses openssl API incorrectly

          Problem
          -------

          The `gov_gen` application generates governance files for testing
          and
          signs them with openssl.  `gov_gen` has a bug on Debian
          12.5 (openssl 3.0.11) where a null argument is passed.

          Solution
          --------

          Pass `mem` as the "in"" parameter and use `PKCS7_STREAM`.
