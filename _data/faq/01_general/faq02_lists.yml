Q: Is there a mailing list or forum or usenet group for discussion of OpenDDS?

A: >
 Yes.  The [GitHub
 Discussions]({{ site.opendds.discussions_uri }}) for the
 OpenDDS project can be used to ask questions and get help.  Please
 remember to use the Problem Report Form (See <a
 href="#general-prf">What's a PRF?</a>) when posting questions (and
 not just "problems").
