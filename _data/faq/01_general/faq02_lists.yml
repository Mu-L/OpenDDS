Q: Is there a mailing list or forum or usenet group for discussion of OpenDDS?

A: >
 Yes.  The DDS mailing lists are available through the
 OpenDDS <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/opendds/">SourceForge
 project page</a>. The archives of previous messages are searchable.
   Please remember to use the Problem Report Form (See <a href="#general-prf">What's a PRF?</a>) when
 posting questions (and not just "problems").
