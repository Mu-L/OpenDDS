# Community Guidelines for Chat Rooms

At Object Computing, home to the OpenDDS<sup>&trade;</sup> project, our core values energize and guide us in all that we do. Those values are:

- All of us is better than any one of us
- Innovate courageously
- Share it back

As part of our commitment to empowering technologists, both within our organization and without, to find inspiration in these values, we invest our resources in open source projects, and through those projects engage with the global open source community.

With this collaboration comes the responsibility to communicate expectations, moderate public discourse, and respond to abuse as necessary. By outlining what we expect within our community, we hope to help you understand how best to collaborate in public OpenDDS forums (including mailing lists and the GitHub repository site). Reports of abuse will be investigated and may result in active moderation of any content that we determine to be in violation of these guidelines.

## Expectations

The primary purpose of the OpenDDS mailing lists and GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and Discussions is to discuss and collaborate on OpenDDS technology and projects. To help maintain a safe, respectful, and productive space for all community members, we expect everyone to adhere to the following guidelines.

- Be welcoming and open-minded
- Be respectful
- Be civil and professional
- Do not post offensive, abusive, or hateful comments.
- Do not harass anyone
- Treat others with respect and consideration

## Prohibited Actions

- Threats of violence
- Hateful speech and discrimination
- Bullying and harassment
- Impersonation
- Doxxing and invasions of privacy
