      OpenDDS Model Capture is done using the
      <a href="index.html#Plug-ins">Eclipse plug-in tools</a>.
      The basic steps to capturing a model are:
    </p>
      <ul><li>Create a <a href="#Main">main diagram</a>.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Create and populate various <a href="#Package">package diagrams</a>
          that define the <a href="#DCPS">DCPS model</a>,
          <a href="#Data">data definitions</a>, and
          <a href="#Qos">QoS policies</a>.</li></ul>
      <ul><li><a href="#Validation">Validate the model</a>.</li></ul>
    <p>
      These steps are outlined below. <em>This outline is not sufficient for using the SDK.</em>
      The OpenDDS Modeling SDK installation includes additions to the
      Eclipse help system that provides details on working with an OpenDDS model.
      See Help &gt; Help Contents &gt; OpenDDS Modeling SDK Guide.

    <a name="Main"><span class="colortitle">Main Diagram</span></a>
    <span class="bodytext"><br />
      <p>
        The main diagram provides the structure that will hold all
        of the other diagrams that will be used in the model.  Files associated with
        the main diagram are the XMI diagram file,
        &lt;model&gt;.opendds_diagram, and a XMI file
        of the semantic model,
        &lt;model&gt;.opendds.  The file &lt;model&gt;.opendds
        is what is used to generate source code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start capturing a model by creating a new main OpenDDS Diagram:
      </p>
        <div align="center">
          <img src="screenshot_opendds_diagram_wizard.png" border="0" alt="new diagram" />
        </div>
      <p>
        This will open a package diagram.  From this diagram all
        of the other diagrams that will be used in the model will
        be created.
      </p>

  <div class="bodytext" align="justify">
    <a name="Package"><span class="colortitle">Package Diagrams</span></a>
    <p>Package diagrams are the main entry point into capturing
      a model.  They allow the developer to specify any package
      structures required for the project as well as defining
      any local or referenced DCPS models, data definitions,
      and QoS policies.  Once terminal (non-package) elements
      have been captured on the diagram, sub-diagrams can
      be opened from them to edit the internal structure of
      those elements.  Those diagrams are described below.

  <div class="panel" align="justify">
    <a name="DCPS"><span class="headertext">DCPS Model</span></a>
    <span class="bodytext"><br />
      <p>DCPS middleware diagrams capture the DDS Entities
        that will be used by the model.  This includes Domain,
        DomainParticipant, Publisher, Subscriber, DataWriter,
        DataReader, Topic, ContentFilteredTopic, and MultiTopic
        Entities.  These elements and their relationships define
        the DDS service that will be generated into a linkable
        library and made available to any linking application.
      </p>

    </span>
  </div>

  <div class="bodytext" align="justify">
    <a name="Data"><span class="colortitle">Data Definition</span></a>
    <p>Data definition diagrams capture the data types that will be
      transported between publications and subscriptions.
      This is a simple graphical representation
      of the data structures that will be written and read
      from the DDS service.  Only data types that have been
      defined in a model can be used by code generated from
      a model.  These types may be included in a model or
      referenced from another model.  This allows data types
      to be defined in a separate, reusable, model that is
      then linked by many other DCPS models.

  <div class="panel" align="justify">
    <a name="Qos"><span class="headertext">QoS Policies</span></a>
    <span class="bodytext"><br />
      <p>QoS Policy diagrams allow commonly used policy values to
        be captured and named.  This allows a project to share
        the same policy values by name, ensuring consistency
        between all uses of those policy values.
      </p>

  <div class="bodytext" align="justify">
    <a name="Libraries"><span class="colortitle">Model Libraries</span></a>
    <p>The OpenDDS Modeling SDK supports <i>model libraries</i>, which are
      packages of QoS policy, data types, or DCPS domain entities, whose
      elements can be used by other model libraries. A library in one model file
      can reference elements from a library in the same file or another file.
    </p>
    <p>Through the use of modeling libraries, reuse and concurrent
      development of different portions of a model is feasible.</p>
    <p>Libraries can optionally be placed in nested UML packages. Through
      the use of libraries and packages, a large complicated model becomes
      more manageable.</p>

  <div class="panel" align="justify">
    <a name="Validation"><span class="colortitle">Validation</span></a>
    <span class="bodytext"><br />
      <p>Validations can be performed at the model level to find semantic
        problems that are not easily detectable in the code. For example,
        during validation of a DataLib a check is made that the size of
        Arrays is greater than 0. As another example, during validation of a DcpsLib,
        a check is made that a DataWriter is associated with a Topic. Resolving validations
        at the model level helps minimize the number of cycles of modeling &gt; code generation
        &gt; testing.
